# SharedComponents

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.0.

## About

This library contains simple components that are shared amongst several projects. To use these components, see how to build the library.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng g c COMPONENT_NAME --project shared-components` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project shared-components`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project shared-components` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file. 

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test:shared` to run all unit tests in a headless Chrome browser in watch mode.
Alternatively run `ng test shared-components` to execute the unit tests.

## Build

You can watch for file changes and build the library with the command `npm run watch:shared`.
Alternatively run `ng build shared-components` to build the library. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library, go to the dist folder `cd dist/shared-components` and run `npm publish`.
